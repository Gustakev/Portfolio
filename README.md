# Portfolio
This repo serves as a portfolio for my public work (and sometimes collaborative work). Some of the zip folders contain reuploaded project repos, while others contain only the executable file(s) and simple "README.txt" files, as some of my work's source code is not meant, or permitted, to be shared online.
